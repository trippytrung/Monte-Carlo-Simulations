1. If you are rolling five dice, implement a Monte Carlo method to determine if the probability that the sum of the faces showing up is equal to 16 is bigger than the probability that the sum of the faces showing up is equal to 20.

2. You're about to get on a plane to Boston. You want to know whether it is raining. You call four random friends of yours who live there and ask each one independently if it's raining. The first two of your friends have a 1/5 chance of telling you the truth, and the other two have a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All four friends tell you that "No" it isn't raining. What is the probability that it's raining somewhere in Boston?
In this problem, based on the answers received, the probability of rain in Boston is the same as the probability that at least one of the four friends is lying. We are going to write code to determine this probability experimentally via Monte Carlo simulations.

3. Mad Max wants to travel from New York to Dallas by the shortest possible route. He may travel over the routes shown in the table below. Unfortunately, the Wicked Witch can block one road leading out of Atlanta and one road leading out of Nashville. Mad Max will not know which roads have been blocked until he arrives at Atlanta or Nashville. Should Mad Max start toward Atlanta or Nashville?

Route	- Length of Route (miles)
New York - Atlanta	866
New York - Nashville	900
Nashville - St. Louis	309
Nashville - New Orleans	532
Atlanta - St. Louis	555
Atlanta - New Orleans	470
St. Louis - Dallas	662
New Orleans - Dallas	505

4) Use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the probability that a normally distributed variable X, with a mean of 4 and standard deviation of 3, takes values inside the interval between -1 and 2.
